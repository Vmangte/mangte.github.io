	<p><strong>The Bernoulli Family</strong></p>
The <em>Bernoulli family</em> was originally from Holland with strong Calvinism religion. In 1567, Philip, the King of Spain,
sent a large army to punish those who were opposed to Spanish rules, enforced adherence to Roman Catholicism,
and re-established his authority. To avoid Spanish religious persecution, the Bernoulli fled to Basel in Switzerland,
which at that time was a great commercial hub of central Europe 

Initially, members of the Bernoulli family were successful traders and prospered in business. All of the Bernoulli
mathematicians were descendants of Nicholas Bernoulli, a prominent merchant in the spice business in Basel.
Despite the non-mathematic family traditions, later members of the Bernoulli turned out to be the most influential
math experts in the academic community.

Within three successive generations, this family produced as many as eight mathematicians who contributed vastly
to the mathematic world. Together with Isaac Newton, Gottfried Leibniz, Leonhard Euler, and Joseph Lagrange, the
Bernoulli family dominated mathematics and physics in the 17th and 18th centuries, making critical contributions
to differential calculus, geometry, mechanics, ballistics, thermodynamics, hydrodynamics, optics, elasticity,
magnetism, astronomy, and probability theory. Unfortunately, the elder Bernoullis were as conceited and arrogant
as they were brilliant. They engaged in bitter rivalries with one another
