<p><strong>Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782)</strong></p>
Daniel Bernoulli was Johann Bernoulli's second son. He was born in Groningen, Netherlands, on February 8, 1700.
As his own father did to him, Johann Bernoulli did not want his son to enter the field of mathematics.In the following year, he
obtained his master's degree. His father eventually allowed Daniel to study medicine, and for the next few years,
Daniel studied in Heidelberg, Germany, and Strasbourg, France
<p>At the
age of twenty-five, he submitted this work to the annual contest of the Paris Academy and won the grand prize.
As a result of this prize and the fame resulting from <em>"Mathematical Exercises"</em> ,Bernoulli was invited by Catherine I
of Russia, widow of Peter the Great, to accept the chair of mathematics at the Imperial Academy in St. Petersburg.
His brother, Nicolaus, was also offered a chair in mathematics at St. Petersburg at the same time</p>
Of course, no one seems to be willing to pay this sum to play this game. So, Daniel Bernoulli's resolution of the
paradox was to suppose that utility is not linear in the payoff but instead, strictly concave, e.g., ln(x). What certain
payoff, c, would an individual with such a utility function regard as equivalent to the St. Petersburg lottery? This c
would have to satisfy:
<p>In(c)=In(4)</p>
And thus, <strong>c = 4 </strong>a rather modest value to place upon the infinite expectation. This is became known as the St.
Petersburg paradox
The relationship between Johann and Daniel became strained when, in 1734, they both competed for the Grand
Prize of the Paris Academy, a school of mathematical and physical sciences. They both won, and the thought of
sharing the prize with his own son sent Johann into a rage. He banned Daniel from his hous
The relationship was damaged further when Johann Bernoulli published a piece on hydrodynamics in 1739
entitled, "Hydraulica" whereas one year earlier, Daniel published "Hydrodynamica," a very similar work. Johann
blatantly plagiarized "Hydrodynamica" in his publication of "Hydraulica," and even made it seem as if his work was
published first by backdating it to 1732. The plagiarism, however, was soon uncovered.
<p>In his later years, Daniel Bernoulli continued to work in <ul>
	<li>calculus,</li><li>mechanics, </li><li>conservation of energy,</li> <li>oscillation,
and </li><li> the movement of bodies in a resisting medium.</li></ul> He was a member of the London Royal Society; the Paris
Academy of Sciences, the Berlin Academy, and the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Bernoulli died in Basel on
March 17, 1782, just a few weeks before his eighty-second birthday</p>
