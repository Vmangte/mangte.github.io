<p><strong>Johann I Bernoulli (1667-1748)</strong></p>
Johann Bernoulli was Jacob Bernoulli's younger brother. He was a brilliant mathematician who made important
discoveries in the field of calculus.However, Johann had no desire to work in the spice industry,
and enrolled in the University of Basel in 1683 to study medicine.
<p>Despite family problems, Johann was an excellent mathematician. Johann was perhaps even more productive as a
scientist than was Jacob.
He used calculus to solve problems which Newton failed to solve regarding the
laws of gravitation. Johann also did lots of important work on the study of the equation</p>
<p>y=x<sup>x</sup></p>
He discovered the Bernoulli series and made advances in theory of navigation and ship sailing.
In 1673, twenty-three years after the
brachistotone problem, Huygens discovered that the cycloid is also the solution of the "tautochrone problem". In
the "tautochrone problem," it is required to find a curve so that a particle, moving under gravity, will reach a given
point on the curve in equal time irrespective of its initial position on the curve.

During his life, Johann was awarded many honors including
membership at the Academies of Science at Paris, Berlin, St. Petersburg, and many others. He passed away in Basel
on the first day of the year 1748.
