	<p>  <strong>Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705)</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li> Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705) - Nicholas Bernoulli's oldest son- was the first in the family to be recognized as a study philosophy and theology, which he greatly resented but he did acquire a theology degree in 1676. </li>
<li> Jacob Bernoulli published five treatises on infinite series between 1682 and 1704. </li>
<li>  Bernoulli's real love was for mathematics and theoretical physics
and it was in these topics that he taught and researched</li>
</ul>
  He then travelled to France,
spending two years studying with the followers of Descartes. In 1681 Bernoulli travelled to the Netherlands and
then to England where, he met several mathematicians, including the famous scientists Robert Hooke (1635-1703)
and Robert Boyle (1627-1691). As a result of his travels, Bernoulli developed correspondence with many
mathematicians which he carried on over many years. He was intrigued with mathematics and astronomy so much
he grew interest in these fields regardless of his father's opposition. Jacob Bernoulli returned to Switzerland and
taught mechanics at the University of Basel since 1683. Although his degree was in theology and he was offered an
appointment in the Church, he turned it down. Bernoulli's real love was for mathematics and theoretical physics
and it was in these topics that he taught and researched

Jacob Bernoulli became the chair of mathematics at Basel in 1695 and held the position until his death in 1705
when the position was taken over by his younger brother, Johann I Bernoulli.
